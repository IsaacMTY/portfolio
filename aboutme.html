        <h2>Hi!</h2>
        <p>My name is Isaac. I am a Grade 12 student currently studying in Vancouver. I will be moving to the University of Toronto next year to study Computer Science. Most of my interests and skills lie in the area of technologies. <br>I was born in Hong Kong and lived most of life there, but then I moved to Canada I guess for a better education. Despite the fact that I have only been exposed to the world of programming for only a short two years, I already developed a solid experience in many competitions. I self-learned html and css in order to create this website, it is written and improvised only by me, myself. <br> I see myself as a chance taker, so please feel free to contact me for whatever reasons, even just pointless chatting if you are bored like me : )</p>
