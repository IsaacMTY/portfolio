        <h1> 3D Pictures Might be The Perfect Gift for Your Friends! </h1>

        <p><br>
          In the mid-1980s, the first 3D printer was created by Charles W. Hull. Then 3D printers quickly gained its popularity in different industries. But now, every single of us can buy ourselves a 3D printer at a pretty low price. Today, I want to introduce an awesome and customisable product that can be printed easily even by beginners. <br><br> 3D pictures, which should be called lithophane but I thought 3D pictures is a better way to describe this. 3D pictures are the perfect gift you can give to your friends and families. As one of my favourate 3D printing projects, it is not only simple and easy, but also very impressive in others eyes! but first, I have to tell you that I am no inventor or founder of lithophane. Instead, my friend told me that is a thing existed and recommended me a Youtube video by RCLifeOn. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XmbdcmvZbP8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br> <br>I tried it on myself and it worked perfectly fine. The only thing is to pay attention to all the detailed settings that were mentioned in the video. I don't recognize myself as a pro in 3D printing, so it should be easy for most beginners too! <br><br> I made a couple of lithophanes and gave it off as my friend's birthday. It can impress people and most of them will think it is a super complicated project, but I can secretly tell you that it is just a simple transformation from a jpg or any picture format to a 3D printable format with only one step. ( Link to the transformation video: <a href="http://3dp.rocks/lithophane/" target="_blank"> Pic->Lithopane</a> ) <br> <br>I hope you found this interesting : )
